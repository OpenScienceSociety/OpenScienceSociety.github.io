### Aims and Scope

The objective of the workshop is to deliver a quantitative understanding of the socio-technical mechanisms involved in open and citizen science. The event will also touch upon practical implementation issues, with talks on software development and best practices. Time and space will be provided to foster emerging ideas and data science projects in the field of complex systems.


### Organization

This one-day CCS’2016 satellite workshop is intended to be socially driven (we will organize a special drinks / dinner gathering for participants the night before), and highly interactive. To foster active knowledge exchange, presentation sessions will alternate with self-organized unconference sessions with informal discussions around self-selected topics.
